# Node Basic Site

## Overview

- Part of The Odin Project's Node Section
- This is a basic website built using Node.js and Express.js, designed to serve static HTML files with simple routing.
- Serves static HTML files from the /public directory.
- Consolidated routing to handle multiple pages using a single route handler

## Routes

The application serves static pages for the following routes:

- `/` - Home page.
- `/about` - About page.
- `/contact` - Contact page.
- `*` - 404 page for undefined routes.

The route logic is handled by a single route handler, which determines the file to serve based on the requested path.
